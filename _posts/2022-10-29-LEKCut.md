LEKCut (เล็ก คัด) is a Thai tokenization library that ports the deep learning model to the onnx model.

I was porting the Deepcut model to the ONNX model. You can use the deepcut model without installing TensorFlow (it can run on CPU), and the model maybe can running on many devices (smartphone, RPi, Cloud, and more that support onnx opset 13)  and other languages (C/C++,  C#,  JS,  and more).
